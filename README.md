# Final_Fantasy_Fantasy_Blitzball
Credit for the concept goes to my friend Bob "plotholeman".  
This code has been used to play a season of Fantasy Blitzball using Final Fantasy characters.Each player makes a .txt doc with their team name and player names, then gives each player stats in ATK, END, CA, SHT, PAS, BLK.  The engine simulates a game of Blitzball and outputs a play-by-play to a .txt file.

You play the coach.  Draft your players, train them, and then pit them against your friends' teams and see who is the best at putting numbers in spreadsheets!
